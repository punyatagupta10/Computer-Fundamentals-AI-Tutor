        "Answer": "Differentiate between tightly coupled system s and loosely coupled system s. Tightly coupled systems are characterized by strong interdependencies between their components. In such systems, components are closely linked, meaning changes in one component often necessitate changes in others. This leads to higher performance and faster communication between components, but reduces flexibility, making maintenance and scalability more difficult. Tightly coupled systems are less adaptable to change, and a failure in one component can cascade across the system, causing widespread disruptions. Loosely coupled systems, on the other hand, have components that interact with minimal dependencies. Each component functions independently, and changes in one part of the system have little impact on others. This design promotes flexibility, scalability, and easier maintenance. Loosely coupled systems are more resilient, as a failure in one component is less likely to affect the entire system. While they may sacrifice some efficiency, the benefits of modularity and adaptability are often seen as outweighing this draw back."

        "Answer": "Differentiate between symmetric and asymmetric multiprocessor. In symmetric multiprocessors (SMP) , all processors share a common memory and have equal access tOSystem resources. Each processor runs its ow n instance of the operating system and can perform any task, leading to   S. R. JENA, SUMAN KUMAR 7 efficient load balancing. If one processor fails, others can take over its tasks, providing fault tolerance. Memory access is shared, and all processors communicate with each other to evenly distribute the workload. H ow ever, the shared memory architecture can lead to performance bottlenecks as more processors are added, limiting scalability. SMP is more complex and costly to implement but offers robust multitasking and fault tolerance. In asymmetric multiprocessors (A MP) , there is a master - slave configuration w here one processor (master) controls the entire system and assigns tasks to other processors (slaves). Only the master processor runs the operating system, making the management centralized. This reduces complexity and cost but creates a potential bottleneck at the master processor, leading to less efficient load balancing. Each slave processor typically handles specific tasks, which may lead to better scalability, but if the master processor fails, the system may stop functioning. AMP is more cost - effective but less flexible and fault - tolerant compared tOSMP."

        "Answer": "What is meant by system call? A system call is a mechanism that allow s user - level programs to request services from the operating system (OS) kernel. Since direct access to hardware and critical system resources is restricted for security and stability, applications use system calls to interact with the OS for tasks like file handling, memory management, and process control. System calls act as an interface between user programs and the OS. When a program needs to execute a task that requires OS intervention such as opening a file, reading data, or creating a new process it makes a system call. The request is then transferred to the kernel, which executes the necessary operations and returns the result to the program. Examples of system calls include read() , w rite() , fork() , and exec() . They provide a controlled way for programs to perform low - level operations without directly manipulating hardware or compromising system integrity. "

        "Answer": "What is SYSG EN and system boot? System Generation is a process used to configure and tailor an operating system tOSpecific hardware and user requirements. During SYSG EN , the system selects appropriate modules, device drivers, and system parameters based on the hardware configuration (e.g., C PU type, memory size, and peripheral devices). The result is a customized version of the OS optimized for the system's needs. SY SG EN ensures that the operating system can interact properly with the hardware and provide required services. System boot refers to the process of starting a computer from a powered - off state and loading the operating system into memory. During booting, the system's firmware (like B IOS or U EFI) performs initi al hardware checks (POST) and locates the bootloader. The bootloader then loads the kernel of the operating system into memory, initial izing processes and services needed to make the system operational. This process is critical for launching the OSand making the system ready for user interaction."

        "Answer": "C om pare and contrast DMA and C ache m emory. D irect Memory A ccess (DMA) and C ache Memory are both used to optimize system performance but serve different purposes. DMA enables peripheral devices to transfer data directly to or from ma in memory without occupying the C PU , allowing large data transfers with minimal C PU involvement. The CPU initiates the transfer, but once started, the D MA controller manages the data flow , freeing the C PU for other tasks. This is highly beneficial for operations requiring large, continuous data streams, like disk reads/w rites or graphics rendering. C ache Mem ory , on the other hand, is a small, fast memory located close to or within the CPU , used to temporarily store frequently accessed data and instructions. B y reducing the need to access slower main memory, cache memory speeds up data retrieval for the C PU , improving processing speed. C ache operates based on temporal and spatial locality principles, predicting which  data the CPU w ill need next. - 5 Evaluating"

Batch system s execute jobs in batches without direct user intervention, often running large, similar tasks that require minimal user input. Jobs are queued and processed sequentially, maximizing resource use but lacking immediate responsiveness. Time - sharing system s , how ever, allow multiple users to interact with the system simultaneously, giving the impression of direct control by rapidly switching between tasks.

        "Answer": "Serial Processing Systems in early computing, serial (or batch) processing was standard. Programs were processed sequentially, one job at a time, without user interaction. This meant that if a job was waiting for I/O operations (e.g., reading from tape), the CPU remained idle, wasting valuable processing time. Computers were expensive and slow , so this idle time was a costly draw back. Users submitted their jobs to operators, who fed them to the computer in batches. Once a job was completed, the results were delivered back to the user, leading tOSignificant delays in job completion."

        "Answer": "Multiprocessor systems involve multiple C PU s w orking in parallel, w hich adds significant complexity to ensuring that operations on shared data are performed atomically. Interrupts, by their nature, can disrupt the execution flow  of a thread or a process by pausing it at any point to handle an external event. While this is useful for responding to time-sensitive tasks, i t undermines the stability of  synchronous primitives that require careful coordination to maintain data consistency.Synchronous primitives such as semaphores, mutexes, and condition variables rely on strict timing and controlled access to shared resources to prevent race conditions. If an interrupt occurs while a thread is in the middle of modifying shared data or holding a lock, it can lead to inconsistent states or deadlocks w hen other processors attempt to access the same data concurrently."

        "Answer": "H andling interrupts in a mult iprocessor environment introduces the risk of losing context or corrupting the state of shared resources. To maintain consistency, the system must ensure that w hen an interrupt occurs, the state of the interrupted process is saved and restored accurately. This can be complex in multiprocessor systems w here multiple C PU s might be attempting to access or modify the same shared memory simultaneously.Moreover, synchronization primitives often need to execute w ithout being preempted to ensure atomicity. If an interrupt preempts such an operation, it can complicate the logic required to resume  the operation correctly. This results in increased overhead for context switching and state preservation, making the system inefficient and prone to errors."

In a multiprocessor system w here synchronous primitives need to coordinate across several C PU s, frequent interrupts can lead to excessive overhead. This overhead not only affects the individual processor's performance but also limits the system's over all scalability.

Scheduling algorithms like First-C om e-First-Serve (FC FS)or Shortest Job F irst(SJF )may maximize CPU  utilization but can cause long response times for interactive tasks.O n theother hand, preem ptive algorithm slike R oundRobin (RR )prioritize quick responses by switching betw een tasks frequently, ensuring that interactive processes get C PU  time sooner.H ow ever, this can low er CPU utilizationdue to the overhead caused by frequent context sw itches,where the CPU  spends more time switching betw een tasks instead of executing them.E xample:In a system w ith both an interactive text editor and a background video rendering process, prioritizing C PU utilization may causethe text editor to experience slow  response times as the long-running rendering task monopolizes theC PU .(ii) A verageT urnaround Tim e andMaxim um Waiting T im eA verageT urnaroundT im e: This is the average time taken from the submission of a process to its completion. Turnaround time includes w aiting time, execution time, and any I/O  time.Maxim um WaitingT ime: This refers to the longest time any process has tow ait before itstarts execution.C onflict:Minim izingaverage turnaround tim efocuses on completing processes quickly, possibly at the cost of letting some processes wait longer. A lgorithms like Shortest JobN ext (SJN )or Priority Schedulingminimize the time for short jobs by executing them first. H ow ever, this can lead to starvation,w here long or low er-priority processes experience extremely high m axim umw aitingtim esince they are constantly postponed.C onversely, algorithms like First-C om e-First-Serve (FC FS)reduce the risk of longw aiting times for any one process by executing processes in the order they arrive, but this often increases the average turnaround tim e, especiallyw hena long job is at the front of the queue, causing shorter jobs to w ait.E xample:In a system w ith both short and long tasks, minimizing turnaround time might keep shorter tasks finishing quickly,but a long-running task mayw ait indefinitely if shorter tasks continue to arrive, leading toan increased m aximum w aiting tim e.(iii) I/ O D eviceU tilization andC PU U tilization S. R. JENA, SUMAN KUMAR61I/O D eviceU tilization: This measures how  effectively input/output devices (e.g.,hard drives, printers) are kept busy. I/O-bound processes rely heavily on device usage rather than CPU  time.C PU U tilization: This refers to how busy the CPU is kept during process execution.C onflict:I/O-bound  processesspenda significant portion of their time w aiting for I/O  operations (e.g., disk reads/w rites), leaving the CPU  idle. If scheduling prioritizes I/O device utilization(by giving preference to I/O-bound tasks), it might result in the CP U being underutilized, as it spends more time w aiting for the I/O operations to complete.O n theother hand, C PU-bound processesuse the CPU heavily, keeping it busy, but may cause I/O-bound processestow ait longer for the CPU , reducingoverall I/O device utilization. Forexample, if the CPU  is fully occupiedw ith long-running computational tasks, I/O  devices remain idle,w aiting for I/O-bound processesto be scheduled.E xample:In a system w ith both I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file copying)and CPU-bound tasks (e.g., video rendering),if the scheduler focuseson maximizing I/O device utilization, it may prioritize I/O-bound tasks, leaving the CPU  underutilized. Conversely, focusing onC PU  utilization may lead to underused I/O  devices, as I/O-bound tasks may not getCPU  time to initiate I/O  operations."

In this algorithm:Each process is assigneda fixed tim e slice or quantum.A fter its time slice expires, the process is preempted, and the next process in the ready queue is scheduled.The process that was preempted is placed at the back of the ready B TL-4A nalyzing S. R. JENA, SUMAN KUMAR64queue andw aits for its turn again.D egree ofFavoring ShortProcesses:Fairness: Round R obin is fairin the sense that every process, regardless of size, gets an equal share ofC PU  time (eachprocess gets the same quantum). This means that short and long processes are treated equally in terms of scheduling.D iscrim ination inFavor ofShortProcesses:oL ow  discrim inationin favor of short processes: Round R obin does not inherently prioritize shorter processes. H ow ever, shorter processesmay benefit indirectly since they can finish execution after one or tw o quanta, reducing their w aiting time comparedto longer processes.oL ong processes: Largeror CPU-boundprocesses may require many quanta to complete, meaning theyare frequently preemptedand forced tow ait multiple turns. This can result in longer turnaround times for long processes.Preem ption: B ecauseR ound R obin preempts processesafter a fixed quantum, it gives short processes more chancesto complete quickly if their total execution time is smaller than the tim e slice.E xample:If a short process requires less CPU  time than the quantum, it might complete w ithin its first turn, reducing its waiting and turnaround times.If a process requires much more CPU  time than the quantum, it w ill experience frequent context switching,w hich does not favor its completion.In summary, Round R obin does not strongly favor short processes,but short processes may still benefit due to preemption after each time slice.(ii) Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)is a more complex, adaptive its behavior andC PU  usage.Processes move between multiple levels of priority queues,w here each level may have different scheduling criteria, such as different time quanta or priority levels.T op-level queues(high priority) typically have shorter tim e quanta.L ow er-level queues(low  priority) have longer tim e quantaand may be scheduled in a round-robin or first-come, first-ser ved (FC FS) manner.D egree ofFavoring ShortProcesses:High discrim ination in favor of shortprocesses: MLFQ  is explicitly designed to favor short processesand interactive tasks.oShort processesthat do notuse their entire quantum in the higher-priority queues remain at those levels, continuingto receive frequentC PU  time and thus completingquickly.oL ong processesorC PU-bound tasks gradually get demoted to low er-priority queues if they consistently use their full quantumw ithout yielding the CPU .These low er-priority queues oftenhave longer quanta and are scheduled less frequently.Feedbackmechanism: If aprocess uses too muchC PU  time, it is moved to a low er-priority queue,w hich means that shortprocesses  S. R. JENA, SUMAN KUMAR65(I/O-bound or interactive)w ill stay in the higher-priority queues and b e scheduled more frequently. T his drastically reduces their w aiting and turnaround times.E xample:A  short I/O-bound processwill stay in the higher-priority queues, getting more frequentC PU  access, allowing it to finish quickly.A  long-running,C PU-bound processw ill be demoted to a low er-priority queue,w here itw ill get few er opportunities to execute, increasing its waiting time.In summary, MLFQ  strongly discrim inates in favor ofshort processes, especially w hen compared to R oundR obin. It dynamically adjusts to favor processes that use lessC PU  time, allowing short processes to complete quickly while penalizing longer processesw ith lower priority.7.Outlineasolutionusingsem aphorestosolvedinningphilosopherproblem .

The challenge is to design a solution that prevents deadlock and ensures that all philosophers can eat.SolutionU sing MonitorsA m onitoris a high-level synchronization construct that allow s threads to safely access shared resources.

It w orksby splitting memory into blocks of sizes that are pow ersof tw o.C oncept:Memory is managed as apool of free blocks,w here the size of each block is a pow er of tw o (e.g., 1KB , 2KB , 4KB , etc.).When aprocess requests memory, the system finds the smallest available block that is equal to or larger than the requested size.If a block of exactly the requested size is not available, the system w ill split a larger block (buddy) into tw o smaller blocks (buddies) until it can allocate the memory.When ablock is freed, the system checks if its \"buddy\" isalso free. If the buddy is free, the tw oare merged back into a larger block, thereby reducing fragmentation.Key Features:Efficient for managing memory in environments where the memory request sizes vary, and it helps to minimize internal fragmentation.The merging of buddies is fast, making memory management more dynamic.A dvantages:Q uick allocationand deallocation of memory.R educes external fragmentation by ensuring that free blocks can be merged into larger blockswhen possible.D isadvantages:Internal fragmentation can still occur because memory is allocated in fixed-size blocks, so a small request may receivea largerblock than necessary.E xample of Buddy System : S. R. JENA, SUMAN KUMAR89memory sizes (block sizes) are powers of tw o (64KB , 32 KB , 16 K B, etc.).A  process requests 18 KB  of memory. The buddy systemw ill find the smallest block that can accommodate this request. Inthis case, it w ill allocate a 32K B block.If only a 64KB  block is free, it w ill split i t into tw o 32KB  blocks, allocate one of these32K Bblocks to the process, and leave the other 32 KB  block free for future allocations.When theprocess releases the memory, the system checks if the buddy (theother 32KB  block) is also free. If both are free, they are merged back into a 64 KB  block."

Each entry in the page table corresponds to one page and holds the frame number w here the page is stored in physical memory.Size of thePageT able: The size of the page table is directly proportional to the number of virtual pages. If the virtual address space is large, the page tablecan be largeas well.Multi-L evel PageT ables:To reduce the size of the page table in large address spaces (e.g., 64-bit systems), m ulti-level pagingis often used. Multi-level paging breaks the page table into smaller chunks and uses multiple layers of indirection.

Thevirtual address issplit into a segment num berand an offsetw ithin that segment.The segment tableis used to translate the virtual addresses to physical addresses.Segm entT able Structure:Segm entT able: The segment table contains oneentry for each segment. Each entry holds the base address (where the segment starts in physical memory) and the limit (the size of the segment).Size of theSegm ent Table: The size of the segment table depends on the number of segments, not the size of the virtual address space. Typically, there are far few er segments than pages, so thesegment table is much smaller than the page table.For example:If a process has5 segments,and each segment table entry requires 8 bytes (4 bytes for the base addressand 4 bytes for the limit), the size of the segment table would be: 5\u00d7 8bytes= 40. This is significantly smaller than a page table for largevirtual address spaces.Segm entation Overhead:Segm ent tablesare small because theyonly need to store information about segments,not individual pages. Each process typically has a small number of segments (e.g., code, data, stack), so the segment table is much more compact.H ow ever, segmentation cansuffer from external fragm entationbecause segments are of variable size, and there might not alw ays be contiguous memory blocks available to fit a segment."

The unused space inside the block isw asted, and this is known as internal fragmentation.C ause: It happens in systems that use fixed-sizedm emory allocation(e.g., fixed-sizedpartitions, paging).E xample: If a system allocates memory in blocksof 4KB , and a process requires only 3K B , the remaining 1KB  is wasted w ithin the allocated block.A lthough this 1 KB  is allocated, theprocess does not use it, and no otherprocess canuse it either.E xternal Fragm entation:D efinition: External fragmentation occursw hen free memory is scattered across the system in small, non-contiguous blocks. A lthough there may be enough total free memory to satisfy a allocated memory.C ause: It happens in systems that use variable-sizedmem ory allocation(e.g.,dynamic partitions).E xample: If a system has free blocks of memory (e.g.,100 KB , 200 K B, 150 KB ), but a process requires 300KB  of contiguous memory, the process cannot be allocated memoryeven though there is a total of 450K B  available, because no singleblock islarge enough.Key D ifferences:Internal Fragm entationhappensw ithin allocated memory blocks, leading to wasted space inside those blocks.E xternal Fragm entationhappensw hen free memory blocks are scattered throughout the memory, preventing the allocation of large contiguous memory.(ii) Situations WhereMFU G eneratesFew erPageFaults than LRU  and V iceV ersaMost Frequently U sed (MFU ) Page R eplacem entA lgorithm :MFUreplaces the page that has beenused the most frequently.

        "Question": "1. H ardware Interrupts",
        "Answer": "A  hardw are interrupt is a condition related to the state  of the hardw are that may be signaled by an external hardw are device, e.g., an interrupt request (IRQ ) line on a PC , or detected by devices embedded in processor logic to communicate that the device needs attention from the operating system. For example, pressing a keyboard key or moving a mouse triggers hardw are interrupts that cause the processor to read the keystroke or mouse position.H ardw are interrupts can arrive asynchronously for the processor clock and at any time during instruction execution. C onsequently, all hardw are interrupt signals are conditioned by synchronizing them to the processor clock andact only at instruction executionboundaries.In many systems, each device is associated w ith a particular IRQ signal. This makes it possible to quickly determine w hich hardw are device is requesting service and expedite servicing of that device.O n some older systems, all interrupts w ent to the same location, and the O S used specialized instruction to determine the highest priority unmasked interrupt outstanding. O n contemporary systems, there is generally a distinct interrupt routine for each type of interrupt or each interrupts source, often implemented as one or more interrupt vector tables. H ardw are interrupts are further classified into tw otypes, such as:oMaskable Interrupts:Processors typically have an internal interrupt mask register which allow s selective enabling and disabling of hardw are interrupts. Each interrupt signal is associated w ith a bit in the mask register; on some systems, the interrupt is enabled w hen the bit is set and disabled w hen the bit is clear, w hile on others, a set bit disables the interrupt. When the interrupt is disabled, the associated interrupt signal w ill be ignored by the processor. Signals w hich are affected by the mask are  S. R. JENA, SUMAN KUMAR172calledmaskable interrupts.The interrupt mask does not affect some interrupt signals and therefore cannot be disabled; these are callednon-maskable interrupts(N MI). N MIs indicate high priority events that need to be processed immediately and w hich cannot be ignored under any circumstances, such as the timeout signal from a w atchdog timer.Tomaskan interrupt is to disable it, w hile tounmaskan interrupt is to enable it.oSpurious Interrupts:A  spurious interrupt is a hardw are interrupt for which no source can be found. The term phantom interrupt or ghost inte rrupt may also use to describe this phenomenon. Spurious interrupts tend to be a problem w ith a w ired-OR  interrupt circuit attached to a level-sensitive processor input. Such interrupts may be difficult to identify w hen a system misbehaves.In a w ired-O R circuit, parasitic capacitance charging/discharging through the interrupt line's  bias resistor w ill cause a s mall delay before the processor recognizes that the interrupt source has been cleared. If the interrupting device is cleared too late in th e interrupt  service routine (ISR ), there w on't be enough time for the interrupt circuit to return to the quiescent state before the current instance of the ISR  terminates. The result is the processor w ill th ink another interrupt is pending since thevoltage at its interrupt request input w ill be not high or low enough to establish an unambiguous internal logic 1 or logic 0. The apparent interrupt w ill have no identifiable source, andhence this is called spurious.A  spurious interrupt may result in system deadlock or other undefined operation if the ISR  doesn't account for the possibility  of such an interrupt occurring. A s spurious interrupts are mostly a  problem w ith w ired-OR  interrupt circuits, good programming practice in such systems is for the ISR  to check all interrupt sources for activity and take no action if none of the sources is interrupting."

Thisarray is sometimes called the raw  disk,and I/O  to this array is called as raw  I/O.B ootblock:When thecomputer is turned on or restarted, the programstored in the initial bootstrap RO M finds the location of theO Skernel from the disk, loads the kernel into memory, and runs theOS.start.To change the bootstrap code, youneed to change the RO M and hardw are chip.O nly a small bootstrap loader program is stored in R OM instead.The A  diskw ith a boot partition is called a boot disk or system disk.The bootstrap program is required for a computer to initiate the booting after it is powered up or rebooted.It initial izes all components of the system, from CPU registers to device controllers and the contents of main memory, andthen starts the operating system. S. R.

Therefore,bootstrap is stored inROM. B ecause of readonly featureof RO M; it cannot be infected by a computer virus. The difficulty is that modification of this bootstrap code requires changing the RO M hardware chips.Therefore, most systems store a small bootstrap loader program in the boot RO M which invokes and bring full bootstrap program from disk into main memory.The modified version of fullbootstrap program can be simply w ritten onto the disk.A  disk that has a boot partiti on is called a boot disk or system disk.B adB locks:D isks are error-prone because moving parts have small tolerances.Most disks are even stuffed from the factoryw ith bad blocks and are handled ina variety ofways.The controller maintains a list of bad blocks.The controller can instruct each bad sector to be logically replaced w ith oneof the spare sectors.
